# Static Files TODO

The following files need to be added manually after the app is built with the template:

- `book_collection.krillnotes` — export a sample workspace with a Library note and 5-8 books
- `book_collection-screenshot.png` — screenshot of the Library on_view

Steps:
1. Load `book_collection.rhai` in Script Manager
2. Create a Library note, add books covering all three statuses (To Read, Reading, Read)
3. Export workspace: File → Export
4. Screenshot the Library view
5. Place both files here and remove this TODO.md
